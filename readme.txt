/* Front-end of a pizzeria restaurant menu in AngularJS */


I am working on this project, following the CodeSchool course: 'Shaping up with AngularJS'.

Because of this, you can notice I use divs at the start, and later, I use custom directives to give sense to the HTML in the app.

This is a the menu front-end of a fictitious pizzeria in London, which I called 'The developer', in Italian, 'Il programmatore'. 

So, to sum up, this part of an app is built using:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 3
- AngularJS
